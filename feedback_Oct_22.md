Report: Incomplete.

Please include in next iteration.
1. Please rename your repo name to 4010_Project_Group02.
2. Please create a separate .md or .txt for the future reports that can be easily edited in the markdown.
3. Import the entire codebase to this repo. I cannot judge your (so-far) work without seeing the code itself.
4. While you are working on the repo as mentioned in references, clearly outline and acknowledge their method in your project ReadMe file. Mention what's missing and how are you improving it.
